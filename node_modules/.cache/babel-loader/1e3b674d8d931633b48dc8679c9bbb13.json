conducting user testing on this final prototype. Our final high-fidelity \n            prototype can be found \n            <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/mqTJLMWseGc08rKOPgbgJp/HiFi?node-id=28%3A4&scaling=min-zoom\" style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }}> <Button size=\"small\" color=\"primary\"> Here</Button></a>.\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography variant='h4' className=\"project-subtitle\">Introduction</Typography>\n            <Typography className=\"text\">\n            Kuleana is a startup that specializes in plant based raw tuna. There are several companies that make vegetable based meat substitutes, such as Beyond Meat, but currently, \n            there is yet to be an established seafood equivalent. Kuleana hopes to capitalize on this by creating 100 percent plant based, sushi-grade raw tuna so that consumers can enjoy \n            fish without the environmental and ethical consequences.\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography variant='h4' className=\"project-subtitle\">Context</Typography>\n            \n\n            <Typography className=\"text\">\n            The goal of this project was to design an interface for an emerging startup. Our group chose to design a website for Kuleana with the purpose of informing consumers about the \n            product and company while providing an easy way to purchase the tuna. Because we focused our design on being intuitive and simple, new and returning customers will be impacted by \n            having a faster experience purchasing the tuna. After many iterations of sketches and wireframes, the project culminated in completing a final hifi mockup of what a website made \n            for Kuleana might look like. We then conducted user testing of this final prototype using the remote user testing service \n            <a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/\" style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }}> <Button size=\"small\" color=\"primary\">Usertesting.com</Button></a>.\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography variant='h4' className=\"project-subtitle\">Design Process</Typography>\n            <Typography className=\"text\">\n            After making 4 initial sketches (which can be viewed in our <a href=\"https://stormy-fjord-40335.herokuapp.com/?fbclid=IwAR1cfoVYyLjRkJNZ30wcYnpGcDHm_q2I2s66Qm4YDZwXpQQBPuXuqcRoGdo\" style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }}> <Button size=\"small\" color=\"primary\"> full report</Button></a>) and deciding on a final design, we used Figma to create a hi-fi prototype - an enhanced version of our final wireframe - populated with realistic content.

Smaller titles followed a consistent styling and size as well, and we also had a consistent paragraph font size.</li>\n                            <li><b>Interaction: </b>We decided to focus on making interaction straight-forward and easy to use. For example, we provided explicit instructions on hovering on our Mission page to eliminate any possible confusion. Furthermore, clickable elements would be enlarged and have a green border upon hover to make it clear that they can be clicked.</li>\n                            <li><b>Navigation: </b>Our navbar contained the main sections of the site, which were accessible from every page.
