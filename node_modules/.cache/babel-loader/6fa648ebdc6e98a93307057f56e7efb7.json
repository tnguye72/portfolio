The images have suspicious alternative text, and when I checked what the alternative text was, I found that the alt text was not very informative. They were all the same, with the words “Newport Sea Foam Trading Co”, except differentiated with an image number. This may provide accessibility issues, as people using screen readers would not be able to understand what the image is specifically showing.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <b>Testing on a Screenreader:</b> I used VoiceOver on Mac to test how it interacts with the site, and it was consistent with the problems I found on WebAIM Wave, which was that the alternative text was not very descriptive. Therefore, it is confusing what the images are showing. \n      </p>\n      <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>\n      <p>Click on each of the devices to view the full-sized lo-fi prototype on different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile, respectively)</p>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      <a href=desktop-lofi.html><img class=\"device\" src=desktop.png alt=\"mobile lofi prototype\"></a>\n      <a href=tablet-lofi.html><img class=\"device\" src=tablet.png alt=\"tablet lofi prototype\"></a>\n      <a href=mobile-lofi.html><img class=\"device\" src=\"mobile.png\" alt=\"mobile lofi prototype\"></a>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      <h2>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>\n      <p>Click on each of the device screenshots to view the full-sized hi-fi prototype on different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile, respectively)</p>\n      <br>\n      <a href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/view/a3643d97-df8b-4cb4-b2ad-95bcde3d2abb-f637/?fullscreen\"><img class=\"device\" src=desktop-hifi.png alt=\"desktop hifi prototype\"></a>\n      <a href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/view/64742bf8-4ed6-4117-8976-5a480fc8fa22-3127/\"><img class=\"device\" src=tablet-hifi.png alt=\"tablet hifi prototype\"></a>\n      <a href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/view/50bf8023-b4ee-4eef-ba5d-c5f2a4344a13-05ec/\"><img class=\"device\" src=mobile-hifi.png alt=\"mobile hifi prototype\"></a>\n      <h2>Style Guide</h2>\n      <img class=\"center\" style=\"width: 70%\" src=\"style-guide.png\" alt=\"UI style guide\">\n      <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>\n        <p>Click <a href=\"https://stark-coast-27589.herokuapp.com/\">here</a> or anywhere on the screenshot below to view the redesigned site!</p>\n        <br>\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://stark-coast-27589.herokuapp.com/\"><img src=\"./screenshot-re.png\" alt=\"screenshot of redesign\"></a>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n        <h2>Testing for Responsiveness:\n        </h2>\n          <p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              I used Developer Tools to test what the site looks like on other devices as well as different screen sizes, and it seems that the design is indeed responsive.
